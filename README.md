# MITx 6.00.2x

## Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

I completed the MITx Computational Thinking using Python XSeries course on the edX verified track between January and May 2022. That course consisted of MITx 6.00.1x and MITx 6.00.2x.

I created this repository in August 2023 to revisit the key course and textbook content, as a refresher prior to commencing a further course in September 2023:

- 6.86x: Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning.

A separate repository will be created to log my progress through that course.
