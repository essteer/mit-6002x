# Simulation models

- A description of computations that provide useful information about the possible behaviours of the system being modeled.

- Descriptive, not prescriptive: they reveal what might happen, but not how to make it happen.

- A simulation is only an approximation to reality.

- "All models are wrong, but some are useful" - George Box.

## Why use simulations?

- To model systems that are mathematically intractable.

- To extract useful intermediate results.

- Simulations lend themselves to development by successive refinement, and "what if" questions; we can begin with simple models, and make them more complex to hone in on more approximate simulations.

## Random walks

- First discovered by Robert Brown, looking at particles moving around in liquid.
- Bachelier took the theory forward with examinations of financial markets.
- Einstein in 1905 wrote a paper on the movement of small particles suspended in liquid, which had a major impact on physics.

Random walks are important in many domains, such as:

- Understanding the stock market
- Modeling diffusion processes

They provide a good illustration of how to use simulations to understand things.
