# A stochastic process is an ongoing process where the next state might depend on both the previous states and some random element.

# Compare the different descriptions of these two functions:
def roll_die_1():
    """returns an int between 1 and 6"""
    pass


def roll_die_2():
    """returns a randomly chosen int between 1 and 6"""
    pass

# roll_die_2() requires randomness - it is a stochastic process.
