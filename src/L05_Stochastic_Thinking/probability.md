# Probability

- Probabilities are always in the range 0 to 1: 0 if impossible, 1 if guaranteed.

- If the probability of an event occurring is p, the probability of it not occurring must be 1-p.

- When events are independent of each other, the probability of all of the events occurring is equal to a product of the probabilities of each of the events occurring.

- Two events are independent, if the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of the other.

**Example - Real Madrid and Barca**

1. If Real Madrid and Barca both have a 7/8 chance of winning matches, the chance of both winning their games is 7/8 \* 7/8 = 49/64.
2. The probability of at least one losing is 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.
3. However, if the two teams play each other, this no longer holds!
