# Monte Carlo

Method invented by Stanislaw Ulam - inventor of the hydrogen bomb - in 1946.

- A method of estimating the value of an unknown quantity, using the principles of inferential statistics.

**Inferential statistics**

- Population: a set of examples
- Sample: a proper subset of a population
- Goal: estimate some statistic about the population, based on statistics about the sample
- Key fact: if a sample is chosen at random, it tends to exhibit the same properties as the population from which it is drawn

**Buffon-Laplace**

Area of a square (As)
As = 2 x 2 = 4

Area of a circle (Ac)
Ac = pi x r^2 = pi

Buffon-Laplace method:

- needles in circle / needles in square = area of circle / area of square
- area of circle (pi) = (area of square \* needles in circle) / needles in square
- pi = (4 \* needles in circle) / needles in square
