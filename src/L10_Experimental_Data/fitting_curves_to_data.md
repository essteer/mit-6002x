# Fitting Curves to Data

- When we fit a curve to a set of data, we are finding a fit that relates an independent variable (e.g., the mass) to an estimated value of a dependent variable (e.g, the distance).

- We need to define an objective function that provides a quantitative assessment of how well the curve fits the data.

- Once we have such a function, finding the best fit can be formulated as finding the curve that minimises the value of that function - a conventional optimisation problem.

- In this case, we want to find a line such that some function of the sum of the distances from the line to the measured points is minimised.

- We measure the distance on the y axis - since we are concerned with a dependent y value (how far the spring drops given a mass), given an independent x (the mass dropped).
