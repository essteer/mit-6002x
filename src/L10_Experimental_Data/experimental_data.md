# Statistics Meets Experimental Science

1. Conduct an experiment to gather data:

   - Physical (e.g., in a biology lab)
   - Social (e.g., questionnaires)

2. Use theory to generate some questions about data:

   - Physical (e.g., gravitational fields)
   - Social (e.g., people give inconsistent answers)

3. Design a computation to help answer questions about data.

**Linear springs**

- The amount of force needed to stretch or compress the spring is linear in the distance the spring is stretched or compressed.

- Each spring has a spring constant, k, that determines how much force is needed.

- k for a slinky: k ~ 1N / m
- k for a motorcycle: k ~ 35,000N / m

- Note that not all springs behave linearly - e.g., archery bows, rubber bands.

**Newton unit**

The amount of force required to accelerate a 1kg mass 1 metre per second, per second.

1N = 1k \* (m / s^2)
