# Mean Square Error

See c_mean_squared_error.py for implementation.

**In an absolute sense**

- Mean square error is useful for comparing two different models for the same data.

- But it may not be useful for getting a sense of the absolute goodness of fit - e.g., is 1,524 good?

- It is hard to know, since there is no upper bound and it is not scale independent.

- R Squared is a solution to this.
