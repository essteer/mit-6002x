# Hooke's Law

F = -kd

The force F, stored in a spring, is linearly related to x, the distance the spring has been compressed or stretched.

The reason for the minus sign before the kd, is that the force exerted by the spring is in the opposite direction to the displacement - if stretched, it wants to compress, and vice versa.

**How much does a rider have to weigh compress a motorcycle spring 1cm?**

F = 0.01m \* 35,000N/m
F = 350N

F = mass \* acceleration
F = mass \* 9.81m/s^2 (9.81 metres per second squared)

The mass is what we are trying to solve for - how much the rider would have to weigh.

The 9.81m/s^2 is a constant that assumes the spring is perpendicular to the Earth's gravitational field.

mass \* 9.81m/s^2 = 350N
mass = 350N / (9.81m/s^2)
mass = 350k / 9.81
mass = 35.68k = 35.68kg

The key here was that we already knew the spring constant for this spring, of 35,000N.

**Finding k**

F = -kx
k = -F/x
k = 9.81\*m/x i.e., (9.81 \* (mass / x))
