# Inferential Statistics

- Population: a set of examples
- Sample: a proper subset of a population
- Goal: estimate some statistic about the population, based on statistics about the sample
- Key fact: if a sample is chosen at random, it tends to exhibit the same properties as the population from which it is drawn

**Law of Large Numbers**

In repeated independent tests with the same actual probability _p_ of a particular outcome in each test, the chance that the fraction of times that outcome occurs differs from _p_ converges to zero as the number of trials goes to infinity.

- Note this does not imply that deviations will be "evened out" by opposite deviations in the future - a misconception known as the Gamblers' Fallacy.
- Gamblers' Fallacy is often confused with Regression to the Mean.

**Regression to the Mean**

Following an extreme random event, the next random event is likely to be less extreme.

The term was coined by Francis Galton, in 1885, on observing the relation between the heights of children and parents.

- 100% reds on 10 roulette wheel spins is an extreme event (p = 1/1024).
- In the next 10 spins, you will likely get less than 10 reds.
- So, the average of the 20 spins will be closer to the expected 50% mean, than to the 100% seen with the first 10 spins.

**Sampling Space of Possible Outcomes**

- Never possible to guarantee perfect accuracu through sampling.
- Not to say that an estimate is not precisely correct.
- The number of samples needed to attain confidence in the answer depends on the variability of the underlying distribution.
