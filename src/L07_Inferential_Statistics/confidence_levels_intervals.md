# Confidence Levels and Intervals

- Instead of estimating an unknown parameter by a single value (e.g., the mean of a set of trials), a confidence interval provides a range that is likely to contain the unknown value, and a confidence that the unknown value lays within that range.

- "The return on betting on 2 twenty times in European roulette is -3.3%. The margin of error is +/- 1 percentage point with a 95% level of confidence.

- Almost always, increasing the confidence level, will widen the confidence interval.

- Confidence level can be calculated using the standard deviation of a set of trials.

**Empirical Rule**

- ~68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
- ~95% of data lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
- ~99.7% of data lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
