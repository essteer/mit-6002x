# PDFs

- Distributions are defined by **probability density functions** (PDFs).
- PDF is the probability of a random variable lying between two values.
- Defines a curve where the values on the x-axis lie between the minimum and maximum value of the variable.
- Area under the curve between two points, is the probability of the example falling within that range.
