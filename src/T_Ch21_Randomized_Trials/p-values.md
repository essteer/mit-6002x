## P-values

The p-value is **NOT** the probability of the null hypothesis being true.

It is more akin to the common law "presumption of innocence": we assume the null hypothesis is true, unless there is sufficient evidence to the contrary.

Just as a jury's "not guilty" ruling implies only that evidence provided was insufficient for a "guilty" ruling, and not that the jury has been convinced the defendant is innocent.

So with a p-value, the standard "beyond reasonable doubt" is determined by Î±, with evidence determined by the data used to construct the t-statistic.

A **small p-value** indicates that a particular sample is unlikely if the null hypothesis is true. (The jury decides that it is unlikely it would have been presented with a given set of evidence, if the defendant were innocent.)

The small p-value could indicate that the null hypothesis is false, but it could also result from a sample that is unrepresentative of the population.

**One-tailed test**

A one-tailed test is appropriate only if the consequences of missing an effect in the untested direction are negligible.
