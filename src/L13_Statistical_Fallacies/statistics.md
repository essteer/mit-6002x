# Statistical Fallacies

Susceptibility to false assertions:

"If you can't prove what you want to prove, demonstrate something else and pretend they are the same. In the daze that follows the collision of statistics with the human mind, hardly anyone will notice the difference." - Darrell Huff

**Anscombe's Quartet**

Groups with identical:

- Mean x = 9.0
- Mean y = 7.5
- Variance of x = 10.0
- Variance of y = 3.75
- Linear regression model: y = 0.5x + 3

May be derived from vastly different data.

**Key points to consider**

1. Statistics about the data, is not the same as the data
2. Use visualization tools to look at the data itself.

But beware that visualisations can also provide a false narrative, e.g. through the maniupulation of axis scales, plots, etc.

3. Always look at axis labels.
4. Always look at the scale.
5. Consider whether the things being compared are even comparable.
6. GIGO.

"On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question." - Charles Babbage (1791-1871)

7. Analysis of bad data can lead to dangerous conclusions.
8. Beware of percentages when the baseline is not known / provided.
