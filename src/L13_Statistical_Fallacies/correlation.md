**Correlation**

**Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc** - _with this, therefore because of this_. (Applied here to the propensity of the human mind to find a pattern or causality where it does not exist.)

- We cannot make conclusions about causation based only on correlation.
- Attempt to control for all variables other than the variables of interest - rarely possible in the real world.

**Randomised control studies**

- The gold standard.
- Begin with a population.
- Randomly assign members to either a control group, or a treatment group.
- Deal with the two groups identically, except with respect to the one variable being evaluated.
- Can be difficult and expensive to implement.
