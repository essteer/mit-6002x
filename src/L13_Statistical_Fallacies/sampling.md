# Sampling

- All statistical techniques are based upon the assumption that by sampling a subset of a population, we can infer things about the population as a whole.

- If random sampling is used, we can make meaningful mathematical statements about the expected relation of the sample to the entire population.

- It is easy to get random samples **in simulations**.

- It is not so easy to get random samples in the field, where some examples are more convenient to acquire than others.

**Non-representative sampling**

- "Convenience sampling" is not usually random - e.g.:

  - survivor bias, course evaluatiopns at the end of a course; or
  - non-response bias, opinion polls conducted online

- When samples are not random and independent, we can still do things like computer means and standard deviations, but:

  - we should not draw conclusions from them using things like the empirical rule and central limit theorem.

- Understand how data was collected, and whether assumptions used in the analysis are justified.
