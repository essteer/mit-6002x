# Scaling

Scaling provides a means of making features comparable.

See scaling.py for implementations of the below two methods.

**Z-scaling**

- Each feature has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

**Interpolation**

- Map minimum value to 0, maximum value to 1, and linearly interpolate everything inbetween.
