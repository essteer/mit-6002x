# K Nearest Neighbours

Advantages

- Learning fast, no explicit training
- No theory required
- Easy to explain method and results

Disadvantages

- Memory intensive
- Predictions can take a long time
  - There are better algorithms than brute force
- Crucially, KNN does not yield a model to shed light on the process that generated the data

**Logistic regression** is a further method (see textbook).
