# Minkowski Metric

A generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 used to calculate the distance between vectors.

p = 1: Manhattan Distance
p = 2: Euclidean Distance

**Euclidian distance** is simply the distance between two points in a straight line.

**Manhattan distance** is derived from the concept of moving between two points in a city such as New York: one must navigate along city blocks, and cannot simply move directly between the two points.

Points A and B may have a Euclidian distance that is shorter than between points A and C, but points A and C may have a shorter Manhattan distance - meaning the path taken to traverse between them is in fact shorter than between A and B.
